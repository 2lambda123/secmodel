The Maturity is set at 30 years and Repayments are pro-rata and monthly.</p><p>This model includes an annual 1% fee calculated monthly on the Asset Portfolio balance and a Reserve Fund (1% of the original Asset Portfolio).</p><p>Recovery of Defaulted assets is set at 50% and is recognised in the same month as the default.  The user sets the Amount of the Asset Portfolio, the Fixed coupons of the Asset Portfolio, Senior Bond and Suborindated Loan and the monthly Prepayment and Default amounts.  <b>Please leave not blanks.</b></p></br><p><b>Purpose</b> : Demonstrate that Securitisations an be modelled using Python.  Certain inputs, such as the Senior Bond and Subordinated Loan amounts, fee percentage, default recovery, recovery time lag and whether repayments are pro-rate or sequential, have been assumed at this stage to simplify the model.  In the future these can be incluced as inputs to the model.</br><p><b>Future Steps</b> : Enable Floating Rates and Default and Prepayment Curves.  Include Risk and Financial analysis.</p></br><p><b><a href="/entry">Click here to enter</a></b></p></br><p><b>About the Developer:</b></p>  <p><b>Adrian Hough</b> used this project to learn about Python, Numpy, Pandas & Flask.</p>  <p>For feedback please contact <b>adhough@hotmail.com</b> or linkedin (<b>www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-hough-528b7b</b>).</p>{% endblock %}
